I study Math, Computer Science, and Psychology at Georgia Tech, with a general focus to understand the brain with computational approach.
Currently, I am a Guest Researcher at the [Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/) at [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/). I remotely continue my summer work with [Dr. Sueyeon Chung](https://sites.google.com/site/sueyeonchung/) and [Dr. Jenelle Feather](https://www.jenellefeather.com/) on studying the role of stochasticity in both ventral visual stream and its computational model, vision ANN's. Back at Georgia Tech, I work with [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/home?authuser=0) on using generative probabilistic models for neural latent discovery/alignment. Previously, I have been very fortunate to work in [Prof. Eva Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/)'s group on topics also lie in the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. 

Apart from academic life, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96906289-zijing), playing table tennis and soccer, and listening to classical music and jazz.

<!-- ## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. I am particularly interested in the following topics.
